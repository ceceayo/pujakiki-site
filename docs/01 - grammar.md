# Grammar
Pujakiki has a very simple grammar. There are three types of *something*, which are `verb`, `thing` and `key`. These will be discussed, in that order, in this document.

## Verbs
A verb is a word that is used to describe the fact that someone is doing something. A verb is always written as is. The word which is found in the dictionary is jotted down. Verbs will never be changed in any way. After writing the verb, the word `ri` (written as `(`) is written and then the content of the verb is written. Afterwards, this is closed with `ru` (written as `)`). Before I begin with writing about the content of the verb, I will first explain what things and keys are.

## Thing
A thing is what in English would be called a noun. A thing is always written as is. The word which is found in the dictionary is jotted down. Things will never be changed in any way. After writing the thing, if the thing has modifiers, the word `risa` (written as `[`) is written and then the content of the thing is written. Afterwards, this is closed with `rusa` (written as `]`). Before I begin writing about the content of the thing, I will first explain what keys are.

## Key 
A key is a word that stands for a question which can be asked about a thing, or about a verb. A key is always written beginning with `ro` (written as `#`). A key does not have content. A key is also used to describe a name.

## Content
A verb and a thing can have content. Content are questions which can be asked about the verb / thing. Content exists of a key, the word `re` (written as `:`), a verb or a thing (which can have content inside of content too) or a key (which never has content). In case there are multiple pairs of key and verb/thing/key, these are seperated by the word `ra` (written as `,`).

## Exceptions
**NEVER** will this language have exceptions on the basic rules which are discussed above. Never.
